#Discord chatbot using OpenAI API

Wanted to make a discord bot that uses the text-davinci-002 engine.
Works, but it's a bit spammy.

You're gonna need to insert your API keys in process.env if you decide to use this bot for yourself. 

Bot listens to "openai" message so start with that and move on, he's going to create completion and reply to you. 

Playground for the bot link: https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/default-adv-tweet-classifier
